Geo-Vulnerability
=================

At this point in the filtering, each of these users has a home location presumably specified. The question we want to answer now is whether or not this home location is geographically vulnerable.

The first examples will use ZoneA from Hurricane Sandy.

This can be expanded to be coastal areas or other evacuation zones (say Florida!)
