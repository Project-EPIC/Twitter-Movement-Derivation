GeoProcessing
=============

These scripts rely on two modules in this directory: 

## [geodistance](https://github.com/eamonustc/geodistance)

Allows us to use the haversine distance formula. This is a fast and efficient method which allows us to not have to deal with projections and such.


## [dbscan_python](https://github.com/choffstein/dbscan)

_Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise_

Using this clustering method allows us to filter out the one-offs and the random points where users tweet.
